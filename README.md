In OCaml using functional-programming I implemented a single headed and single tape Turing machine from a description provided in json.<br>
The Turing machine is the first mathematical and algorithmic model behind a general purpose computer.

## Dependencies
On mac I installed ocaml's compiler with `brew install ocaml`.
